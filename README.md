# üçª BRITISH BEERS

This website was developed for study purposes, aiming to learn new features of Next.js App Router through practice. As a keen enthusiast of British beers, I built a simple e-commerce site focused on data retrieval.

Since this project was solely for studying App Router, I created a basic API using Next.js itself. I did not focus on site responsiveness, nor did I include a shopping cart page or purchasing tool.

## Main Features

- SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- Dynamic Routes
- Suspense with Fallback
- Caching and Memoization
- OpenGraph Image
- Page Metadata
- Route Handlers
- Static Params

## Stacks

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Extra Packages Installed

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/https://www.framer.com/motion/)
